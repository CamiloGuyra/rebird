\arguments{
  \item{species}{scientific name of the species of interest
  (not case sensitive). See eBird-1.1-SpeciesReference for
  a complete list of supported scientific names}

  \item{lat}{decimal latitude - value between -90.00 and
  90.00, two decimal places of precision required (is it?)}

  \item{lng}{decimal longitude - value between -180.00 and
  180.00, two decimal places of precision required (?)}

  \item{dist}{distance defining radius of interest from
  given lat/lng in kilometers - value between 0 and 50,
  defaults to 25}

  \item{back}{the number of days back to look for
  observations - value between 1 and 30, defaults to 14}

  \item{maxResults}{the maximum number of result rows to
  return in this request - value between 1 and 10000,
  defaults to all}

  \item{locale}{Language/locale of response (when
  translations are available).  See
  http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html
  - defaults to en_US}

  \item{includeProvisional}{should flagged records that
  have not been reviewed be included? - defaults to F}

  \item{hotspot}{should results be limited to sightings at
  birding hotspots?  - defaults to F}

  \item{sleep}{Time (in seconds) before function sends API
  call - defaults to zero.  Set to higher number if you are
  using this function in a loop with many API calls.}

\value{
  comName species common name

  presence was noted

  lat latitude of the location

  otherwise

  obsValid TRUE if observation has been deemed valid by
  either the automatic filters or a regional viewer, FALSE
  otherwise
