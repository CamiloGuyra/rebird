\usage{
get_freq(loctype, loc, startyear = 1900, endyear = format(Sys.Date(),
  "\%Y"), startmonth = 1, endmonth = 12, long = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{loctype}{String with location type. Either "states", "counties",
or "hotspots".}

\item{loc}{String with location identifier. If querying states
or provinces, the two letter country code followed by the
two letter state code and separated by "-" (e.g. "US-NY").
If querying counties, is as in states/provinces, but appending
county identifier after a dash. For counties in the US,
the county codes is a 3-digit number specific to each state
(e.g. Bronx County: "US-NY-005"). For counties in Canada,
county codes are two-letter identifiers (e.g. Metro Vancouver:
"CA-BC-GV").
If querying hotspots then the unique identifier is a 6-digit
number prepended with an "L" (e.g. "L196159"). All these codes
can be found by looking at the URL in the Explore Data eBird
page (http://ebird.org/ebird/GuideMe?cmd=changeLocation).}

\item{startyear}{Starting year for query. Defaults to 1900.}

\item{endyear}{Ending year for query. Defaults to current year
specified by Sys.Date().}

\item{startmonth}{Starting month for query as an integer (1-12).
Defaults to January.}

\item{endmonth}{Ending month for query as an integer (1-12).
Defaults to December.}

\item{long}{Logical, Should output be in long format? Defaults
  to TRUE. If FALSE then output will be in wide format.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the collected information. If in long format:

"mo_qt": month and week (eBird data divides each month by four weeks)

"Species": species common name

"Freq": proportion of times the species was seen in a specified week

"sample_size" number of complete eBird checklists submitted for
   specified given week

If in wide format, then first column is the species list and all
  other columns are of individual weeks (four in each month). First row
  contains the number of complete checklists for each week.
